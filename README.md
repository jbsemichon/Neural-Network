# Neural Network
Contains all of the current models of my attempts at implementing a Neural Network that incorporates parts of Stochastic Gradient Descent. None of the programs currently work in their present form.
##Update 21/07/19
Now contains a very basic working version of a neural network without the stochastic gradient descent part.
